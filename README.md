My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) written in [Euphoria](https://github.com/OpenEuphoria/euphoria).

* [Advent of Code 2022](2022/)

Each solution takes its input via `STDIN` so you would run them like this:

    $ eui day01.ex < input
	$ eui part2.ex < input

You'll need to provide [your own](https://adventofcode.com/2022/auth/login) input files.
